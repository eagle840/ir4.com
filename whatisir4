What is: IR4, Industrial Revolution 4, also known as 'Industry 4.0'

Basically I see it as a paradigm shift in our world as much as the transistor was, let me quote the World Economic Forum:

There are three reasons why today's transformations represent not merely a prolongation of the Third Industrial Revolution but rather the arrival of a Fourth and distinct one: velocity, scope, and systems impact. The speed of current breakthroughs has no historical precedent. When compared with previous industrial revolutions, the Fourth is evolving at an exponential rather than a linear pace. Moreover, it is disrupting almost every industry in every country. And the breadth and depth of these changes herald the transformation of entire systems of production, management, and governance.[1]

At the heart of these transformations will be: 
- IoT, 
- cloud computing, 
- Big Data, 
- AI (inc ML, NLP, speech, vision, interaction) 
- Cyber-systems. 
And I believe an engineer that is ready for this transformation should be competent in some of them, as well as the ability to handle these rapid changes.

Some examples of IR4 technology:
Self driving cars/trucks
Self check-outs
Auto translate.
Smart cities/factories
Augmented reality

Here's a quick 4 minute video from the US business network CNBC describing the impact of IR4. And the link to World Economic Forum is good read too.
